# Image Segmentation and Its Techniques
 In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is a process
 that involves separating a wide variety of images into various segments. The goal
 of this procedure is to simplify and improve the representation of an image.
 
 The role of image segmentation is very important in image processing. The
 partitioning of an image into multiple segments makes it easier for further process.
 Thus, after completing the operations, image will be re-joined. Segmentation in
creases the accuracy of recognising the object in an image and reduces the loss.
 Semantic segmentation and Instance segmentation are the available types of image
 segmentation based on the problem we use image segmentation.
